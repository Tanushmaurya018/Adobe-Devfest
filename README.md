# Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to categorize PDF documents based on their text content.
The model is trained using a dataset containing information of various documents in the dataset.csv file, and it utilizes the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.

To run just double click the main.py file (open with python and not VSCode or PyCharm).
The bot will run 
Go to the PDF that you want to scan and press CTRL+P on it (ctrl+P might not work at the start so click it 3-4 times or refresh PDF doc or switch to other pdf 1-2 times)
You wil get the notification of which category it lies.

Happy coding!
